# Calculation game

Side project, just for testing purposes.

I set myself a constraint: only use the new Composition API of Vue 3. Complex enough to cover and experiment the major parts of this API.

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```
